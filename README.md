## Description

2nd project of the Graphic Branch of Hive.
A fractal is a never-ending pattern. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems â€“ the pictures of Chaos.

## Features

Multiple fractals : Mandelbrot, Julia, BurningShip, Sphere.
Increase and decrease max iteration for shape calculation.
Zoom and unzoom.
Different colors patterns.
